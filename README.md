Python and Machine Learning Algorithm-based Recommendation System for Lego
Built a recommendation system to assist special-needs adolescents in identifying the best-fit accommodating Lego set suitable for specific needs; user input variables included age (1-18 years), special-need (no special need, ADHD, ASD, and visual impairment), and maximum price (open range)
Cleaned and preprocessed data (&gt;18K rows) using Pandas, Numpy, and SciKit-Learn; identified and used features providing the highest accuracy and desired results
Tested the data on several Machine Learning algorithms (RandomForest, NeuralNetworks, K-NearestNeighbor) to predict accuracy; the data was overfitted, requiring label restructuring to facilitate easier identification of patterns
